        <h2>
            Scope determines the accessibility (visibility) of variables. <br>
            JavaScript Function Scope <br>
            In JavaScript there are two types of scope: <br>

            Local scope <br>
            Global scope <br>

            Scope determines the accessibility (visibility) of these variables. <br>

            Variables defined inside a function are not accessible (visible) from outside the function.
        </h2>
        <h2>
            Local JavaScript Variables
        </h2>
        <h3>
            Variables declared within a JavaScript function, become LOCAL to the function. <br>

            Local variables have local scope: They can only be accessed within the function. <br>
            
            Example <br>
            // code here can not use carName <br>
            
            function myFunction() { <br>
                var carName = "Volvo"; <br>
            
                // code here can use carName <br>
            
            }
        </h3>
        <h3>
            Since local variables are only recognized inside their functions, variables with the same name can be used in different functions. <br>

            Local variables are created when a function starts, and deleted when the function is completed. <br>

            Global JavaScript Variables
        </h2>
        <h3>
            A variable declared outside a function, becomes GLOBAL. <br>

            A global variable has global scope: All scripts and functions on a web page can access it. <br>
            
            Example <br>
            var carName = " Volvo"; <br>
            
            // code here can use carName <br>
            
            function myFunction() { <br>
            
                // code here can use carName  <br>
            
            } <br>

        <h3>
            JavaScript Variables <br>
            In JavaScript, objects and functions are also variables. <br>

            Scope determines the accessibility of variables, objects, and functions from different parts of the code. <br>
        </h3>
        <h2>
            Automatically Global
        </h2>
        <h3>

            If you assign a value to a variable that has not been declared, it will automatically become a GLOBAL variable. <br>

            This code example will declare a global variable carName, even if the value is assigned inside a function. <br>

            Example <br>
            myFunction(); <br>

            // code here can use carName <br>

            function myFunction() { <br>
                carName = "Volvo"; <br>
            } <br>

        <h2>Strict Mode</h2>
        <h3>
            All modern browsers support running JavaScript in "Strict Mode". <br>

            You will learn more about how to use strict mode in a later chapter of this tutorial. <br>

            Global variables are not created automatically in "Strict Mode". <br>
        </h3>
        <h2>Global Variables in HTML</h2>
        <h3>
            With JavaScript, the global scope is the complete JavaScript environment. <br>

            In HTML, the global scope is the window object. All global variables belong to the window object. <br>
            
            Example <br>
            var carName = "Volvo"; <br>
            
            // code here can use window.carName <br>

        </h5>
        <h2>Warning</h2>
        <h3>
            Do NOT create global variables unless you intend to. <br>

            Your global variables (or functions) can overwrite window variables (or functions). <br>
            Any function, including the window object, can overwrite your global variables and functions. <br>
        </h3>
        <h2>The Lifetime of JavaScript Variables</h2>
        <h3>
            The lifetime of a JavaScript variable starts when it is declared. <br>

            Local variables are deleted when the function is completed. <br>

            In a web browser, global variables are deleted when you close the browser window (or tab), but remain available to new pages loaded into the same window. <br>
        </h3>
        <h2>Function Arguments</h2>
        <h3>
            Function arguments (parameters) work as local variables inside functions.
        </h3>
