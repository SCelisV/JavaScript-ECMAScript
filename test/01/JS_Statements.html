        <h2>JavaScript Programs</h2>
        <h3>A computer program is a list of "instructions" to be "executed" by a computer. <br>
            
            In a programming language, these programming instructions are called statements. <br>
            
            A JavaScript program is a list of programming statements. <br>
            
            In HTML, JavaScript programs are executed by the web browser.</h3>
            
        <h2>JavaScript Statements</h2>
        <h3>JavaScript statements are composed of: <br>
            
            Values, Operators, Expressions, Keywords, and Comments. <br>
            
            This statement tells the browser to write "Hello Dolly." inside an HTML element with id="demo":</h3>
                
        <h5><a href="MyEx_JS_Statements_02.html" target="_blank">Example: JS_Statements_02</a></h5>        

        <h3>
                Most JavaScript programs contain many JavaScript statements. <br>

                The statements are executed, one by one, in the same order as they are written. <br>
                
                JavaScript programs (and JavaScript statements) are often called JavaScript code. <br>
        </h3>

        <h2>Semicolons ;</h2>
        <h3>
            Semicolons separate JavaScript statements. <br>

            Add a semicolon at the end of each executable statement: <br>

                var a, b, c;     // Declare 3 variables <br>
                a = 5;           // Assign the value 5 to a <br>
                b = 6;           // Assign the value 6 to b <br>
                c = a + b;       // Assign the sum of a and b to c <br>
        </h3>

        <h5><a href="MyEx_JS_Statements_03.html" target="_blank">Example: JS_Statements_03</a></h5>
        
        <h3>When separated by semicolons, multiple statements on one line are allowed: <br>
            a = 5; b = 6; c = a + b;</h3>

        <h2>JavaScript White Space</h2>
        <h3>
            JavaScript ignores multiple spaces. You can add white space to your script to make it more readable. <br>
            
            The following lines are equivalent: <br>
            var person = "Hege"; <br>
            var person="Hege"; <br>
            A good practice is to put spaces around operators ( = + - * / ): <br>
            var x = y + z; <br>
            
        </h3>
        <h2>JavaScript Line Length and Line Breaks</h2>
        <h3>For best readability, programmers often like to avoid code lines longer than 80 characters. <br>
            
            If a JavaScript statement does not fit on one line, the best place to break it, is after an operator: <br>
            document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML = <br>
            "Hello Dolly!";
        </h3>
        <h5><a href="MyEx_JS_Statements_05.html" target="_blank">Example: JS_Statements_05</a></h5>
        
        <h2>JavaScript Code Blocks</h2>
        <h3>
            JavaScript statements can be grouped together in code blocks, inside curly brackets {...}. <br>
            
            The purpose of code blocks is to define statements to be executed together. <br>
            
            One place you will find statements grouped together in blocks, is in JavaScript functions:
            <br>
            
            function myFunction() { <br>
                document.getElementById("demo1").innerHTML = "Hello Dolly!";  <br>
                document.getElementById("demo2").innerHTML = "How are you?";  <br>
            }  <br>
        </h3>

        <h2>JavaScript Keywords</h2>
        <h3>JavaScript statements often start with a keyword to identify the JavaScript action to be performed. <br>

                Here is a list of some of the keywords you will learn about in this tutorial:</h3>
        
                <table>
                    <tr><td>Keyword</td><td>Description</td></tr>
                    <tr><td>break</td><td>Terminates a switch or a loop</td></tr>
                    <tr><td>continue</td><td>Jumps out of a loop and starts at the top</td></tr>
                    <tr><td>debugger</td><td>Stops the execution of JavaScript, and calls (if available) the debugging function</td></tr>
                    <tr><td>do ... while</td><td>Executes a block of statements, and repeats the block, while a condition is true</td></tr>
                    <tr><td>for</td><td>Marks a block of statements to be executed, as long as a condition is true</td></tr>
                    <tr><td>function</td><td>Declares a function</td></tr>
                    <tr><td>if ... else</td><td>Marks a block of statements to be executed, depending on a condition</td></tr>
                    <tr><td>return</td><td>Exits a function</td></tr>
                    <tr><td>switch</td><td>Marks a block of statements to be executed, depending on different cases</td></tr>
                    <tr><td>try ... catch</td><td>Implements error handling to a block of statements</td></tr>
                    <tr><td>var</td><td>Declares a variable</td></tr>
                </table>
