        <h2>
            JavaScript variables are containers for storing data values. <br>
            In this example, x, y, and z, are variables: <br>
            var x = 5; - x stores the value 5 <br>
            var y = 6; - y stores the value 6<br>
            var z = x + y; - z stores the value 11<br>

        <h2>Much Like Algebra</h2>
        
        <h3>In this example, price1, price2, and total, are variables: <br>
            var price1 = 5; <br>
            var price2 = 6; <br>
            var total = price1 + price2; <br>

        <h2>JavaScript Identifiers</h2>
        <h3>
            All JavaScript variables must be identified with unique names. <br>
            These unique names are called identifiers. <br>

            Identifiers can be short names (like x and y) or more descriptive names (age, sum, totalVolume). <br>
            
            The general rules for constructing names for variables (unique identifiers) are: <br>

            - Names can contain letters, digits, underscores, and dollar signs. <br>
            - Names must begin with a letter <br>
            - Names can also begin with $ and _ (but we will not use it in this tutorial) <br>
            - Names are case sensitive (y and Y are different variables) <br>
            - Reserved words (like JavaScript keywords) cannot be used as names <br>

        <h2>The Assignment Operator</h2>
        <h3>
            In JavaScript, the equal sign (=) is an "assignment" operator, not an "equal to" operator. <br>

            This is different from algebra. The following does not make sense in algebra: <br>
            
            x = x + 5 <br>
            In JavaScript, however, it makes perfect sense: it assigns the value of x + 5 to x. <br>
            
            (It calculates the value of x + 5 and puts the result into x. The value of x is incremented by 5.) <br>
            
            The "equal to" operator is written like == in JavaScript. <br>
        </h3>

        <h2>JavaScript Data Types</h2>
        <h3>
            JavaScript variables can hold numbers like 100 and text values like "John Doe". <br>
            
            In programming, text values are called text strings. <br>
            
            JavaScript can handle many types of data, but for now, just think of numbers and strings. <br>
            
            Strings are written inside double or single quotes. Numbers are written without quotes. <br>
            
            If you put a number in quotes, it will be treated as a text string. <br>

        <h2>Declaring (Creating) JavaScript Variables</h2>
        <h3>
            Creating a variable in JavaScript is called "declaring" a variable. <br>
            
            You declare a JavaScript variable with the var keyword: <br>
            
            var carName; <br>
            After the declaration, the variable has no value. (Technically it has the value of undefined) <br>
            
            To assign a value to the variable, use the equal sign: <br>
            
            carName = "Volvo"; <br>
            
            You can also assign a value to the variable when you declare it: <br>
            
            var carName = "Volvo"; <br>
            In the example below, we create a variable called carName and assign the value "Volvo" to it. <br>
            
            Then we "output" the value inside an HTML paragraph with id="demo": <br>

        <h2>One Statement, Many Variables</h2>
        <h3>
            You can declare many variables in one statement. <br>
            
            Start the statement with var and separate the variables by comma: <br>
            
            var person = "John Doe", carName = "Volvo", price = 200; <br>

        </h5>
        
        <h2>Value = undefined</h2>
        <h3>
            In computer programs, variables are often declared without a value. The value can be something that has to be calculated, or something that will be provided later, like user input. <br>
            
            A variable declared without a value will have the value undefined. <br>
            
            The variable carName will have the value undefined after the execution of this statement: <br>

            var carName; <br>

        </h5>
    
        <h2>Re-Declaring JavaScript Variables</h2>
        <h3>
            If you re-declare a JavaScript variable, it will not lose its value. <br>

            The variable carName will still have the value "Volvo" after the execution of these statements: <br>
            
            var carName = "Volvo"; <br>
            var carName; <br>

        <h2>JavaScript Arithmetic</h2>
        <h3>
            As with algebra, you can do arithmetic with JavaScript variables, using operators like = and +: <br>
            var x = 5 + 2 + 3; <br>
            
            You can also add strings, but strings will be concatenated: <br>
            var x = "John" + " " + "Doe"; <br>

            Also try this: <br>
            var x = "5" + 2 + 3; <br>

            If you put a number in quotes, the rest of the numbers will be treated as strings, and concatenated. <br>
            
            Now try this: <br>
            var x = 2 + 3 + "5"; <br>
